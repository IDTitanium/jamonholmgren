Hey there! You're looking at my personal website source code.

I'm Jamon Holmgren, a software developer who is also a cofounder of [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red), a husband, and a father of four. I live near Portland, Oregon, across the mighty Columbia River in the beautiful southwest corner of Washington state.

## Quick Start

Assuming you've installed a relatively recent node and yarn, clone the repo down, cd into the directory, and run this:

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn run dev
```

To deploy, run this:

```
# TODO
```
