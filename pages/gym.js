      <p>
        In November of 2016 I started working out with Ryan Linton. I was 30 lbs
        overweight and starting to feel my age. I knew if I didn't do something
        soon, I was going to have a body that would hurt for a long time.

        </Link>
        I started thinking about building an in-home gym. After all, I have a
        three-car garage and plenty of room, and while I was doing well getting
        to the gym two to three times per week, I knew I would do better if the
        gym was in my house.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started by doing a bunch of research and ordered the parts. Here's
        what I have so far and what I am planning to do next.

          Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack
        </a>
      </h4>

      <p>When it comes to lifting, don't scrimp on the bar or the rack.</p>

      <p>
        The RML-3W wall rack has been awesome. I do recommend getting the metal
        stringers to mount to the wall. It took me and my 13 year old son an
        hour or so to install and is rock-solid. It's mounted to a wall with 2x6
        studs and the lag bolts hold it very securely. The garage floor slopes a
        bit left-to-right which means I did slide a little 1.25lb weight under
        one side to level out the rack, but I don't notice the 1/2" difference
        side-to-side. There's also a super simple adjustment in the way it's
        engineered that lets it sit on the floor no matter what.
      </p>

        alt="Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack"
      />

      <p>
        When folded against the wall, it takes up very little room. I don't
        however fold it up very often -- there really isn't any point, since
        there's plenty of room to do everything we need to do, and we don't park
        in that garage bay. It takes about 2 minutes to fold up or unfold. The
        J-hooks are solid and it feels pro. I'm 6'-4" and the pull-up bar is
        high enough (especially considering I don't have much more ceiling
        height to work with).

        The Alpha set includes the{" "}

          Rogue Ohio Bar (20kg/44lbs)
        </a>{" "}
        in Black Zinc/Bright Zinc. I absolutely love this bar. It's somewhat
        flexible so it feels "alive" and yet has the strength to easily load on
        400 lbs, which is the most I've put on it. It's also 28.5mm in diameter
        (1 1/8‚Äù) which is somewhat smaller and feels very good in the hand. It
        works great for deadlift, squats (front and back), bench, overhead
        press, and everything else I've tried it with.

      <p>
        The bumper set is great because it includes four 45 lb bumper plates,
        two 35s, two 25s, and two 10s. Bumper plates are fantastic, if you
        haven't tried them yet. I will only buy bumper plates for the majority
        of my bar weight. It also comes with V3 Monster Lite J-Cups (j-hooks)
        and a pair of Rogue Spring Collars.

        This set of interlocking rubber mats was perfectly sized for my gym. It
        was so easy to put together that my kids did it. They feel good on my
        feet and withstand the bumper plates being dropped without a problem.

        To store all the dumbbells and a few of the barbells, we bought this

      <p>
        These dumbbells aren't my favorite. I actually have two sets, since I
        bought one set from my brother. They sit mostly unused on the weight
        rack now that I have the other dumbbells (see below). I would only
        recommend buying them if you're on a tight budget but need a really wide
        and flexible range of weight. They're a pain to adjust and frequently
        come loose. They also tend to clink together when doing overhead press,
        because the bars are super long. But I have also put a lot of heavy reps
        up with them, so they will do the job.
