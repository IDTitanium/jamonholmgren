        Experiencing Facebook for the first time again, through my 75 year old mother-in-law’s eyes.
      </h1>

      <p><em>Published January 13, 2016</em></p>

      <p>Last night, I set up my mother-in-law’s new tablet.</p>

      <p>
        My mother-in-law was born in 1940 and, other than a stint working at Montgomery Ward in the 60s, was a stay-at-home mom for decades. She hasn’t had a smart phone or real internet access before yesterday. Years ago, my brother-in-law set her up with a hand-me-down PC with Windows XP and Juno email, which is an old-school dialup email service that somehow still works. My mother-in-law isn’t encumbered by years of Facebook reactionism, Reddit cynicism, Youtube superficiality, or Twitter narcissism. But she’s also been missing out on a lot of life that now happens online.

      <p>
        Last week, a Verizon rep convinced her and her husband that getting a free 4G Android tablet would save them money on their phone bill in the long run.

        I first set up her email on the tablet. I showed her how to launch the app by tapping on it, how to go back to the home screen, how to read and delete emails. I showed her how dragging your finger up and down on the screen would scroll up and down.
        I then set up Facebook, and invited her into a secret group for her family that we set up. I showed her how to “like” posts and comments and how to navigate the various screens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within minutes she was receiving friend requests from her kids and grandkids. When she “liked” one of my comments, I showed her how the notification immediately showed up on my phone.

      <p>
        Right now, she’s seeing photos of her grandkids in Alaska and chatting in realtime with her son in South Carolina. Her social life just expanded exponentially with a cheap tablet and 500 MB of data.

        As a software developer, I am immersed in the nitty-gritty every day. I deal with estimates and deadlines, app performance issues, and misaligned text labels. My daily focus is on the what, not the why.

      <p>As my friend and fellow Infinite Red-er Derek Greenberg said,</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It’s important that we remember who our audience is, and to understand that sometimes our work has a huge effect on people who are not our typical target audience.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That’s why it was so striking to watch her discover this brand new world. Through her eyes, I experienced the wonder of the technology I use every day as if it were new again.
